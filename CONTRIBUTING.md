# Contributing Guidelines

We hope you are enjoying Check and look forward to hearing your feedback. Whether you want to raise a bug report, a feature request or just request a correction to something, we really value our community input.

We do ask that you read this document and send us any issues or raise pull requests to make sure we understand clearly what you are asking for. This will help ensure we are making the right decisions and taking the right actions.

## Feature requests and bug reports

You are very welcome to create new issues on this project to request new features and report bugs on any of the Check services.

If you would like to suggest a new feature, we ask that you please use our issue template. This contains a few essential questions that help us understand the problem you are looking to solve and how you think your recommendation will address it. We also tag incoming issues from this template with "community_new". This lets our team quickly see what has been raised and better address the community recommendations.

To see what has already been proposed by the community you can look [here](https://github.com/meedan/check/labels/community_new).

"Watch out for duplicates!" If you are creating a new issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/meedan/check/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/meedan/check/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20) . Having a single issue with multiple votes is far easier for us to prioritize.
